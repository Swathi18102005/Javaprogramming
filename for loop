//The while loop and do while loop are useful for many situations, but you must controlthe boolean condition ensuring that the variables change and eventually make the
condition false
 If you know how many times you want to iterate, the for loop is probably the best choice

//work flow
1. The initial condition statement (the 1st portion in parentheses) is executed
2. The boolean expression (the 2nd portion in parentheses) is tested to see if it is true. 
If so, the body of the loop is executed if it is false, the for loop is exited.
3. The iteration statement (the 3rd portion in the parentheses) is executed. Itreturns to Step 2 and continues until the loop is exited.

//syntax
for (initial_condition; boolean_expression; iteration)
{
 // loop block
}

//forloop
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int count = 1; count <= 10; count++) 
        {
            System.out.println(count);
        }
    }
}
